<h2 id="what-tldr">What (TLDR)</h2>
<p>I’m making a game with my own custom engine, and documenting the most
interesting/useful things I’ve learned</p>
<p>I’m also going into it blind, never having used a game engine
before</p>
<p>I will also share my opinions on the things I use</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<p>I’ve always had an interest in videogames. I witnessed their
evolution, and remember being blown away by minecraft, as I could not
comprehend that a computer could handle an infinite world where you
could build and destroy anything. Even a lever opening a door raised so
many questions. How did the game know that this lever should open the
door? Why does it open instantly and not smoothly? How does anything
about a game work? How do you make one? I though someday I will be able
to understand all of this and make my own game, with my own smooth
doors.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve done some small projects that enabled me to learn some
of the required skills. I started by experimenting with C++ and OpenGL,
learning completely on my own which brought me a lot of pain an
suffering. I will never forget my first textured quad. Taking
inspiration from <a href="https://youtu.be/lS_qeBy3aQI">this video</a>,
I made a <a href="https://github.com/IVSOP/Particles">particle
simulator</a>, which allowed me to learn some rendering concepts (like
batching and instancing) and also get comfortable with some optimization
techniques, like SIMD and spatial partitioning.</p>
<p>I then made an extremely naive implementation of a minecraft-like
game, teaching me some 3D skills. It also made me realize how much goes
into a 3D engine, and how performance intensive 3D graphics are when not
optimized properly.</p>
<p>At university, I got to do a very simple 3D graphics engine, which
pushed me to learn many more advanced concepts, like bloom, HDR and
color correction, rendering models and bezier surfaces, texture buffers,
framebuffers, blinn-phong lighting, and also learning the actual math
behind all of these. I just used the 🐐 <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl</a> for this.</p>
<p>Eventually I came accross videos on voxel engines like <a href="https://youtu.be/40JzyaOYJeY">this</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/qnGoGq7DWMc?">this</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/NwP2VVnRt3Q">this</a>, which were so impressive
they re-sparked my interest for minecraft, and how I could make a better
version of it.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve graduated in Software Engineering, and felt like I
finally had the skills to (begin to) tackle this.</p>
<p>I actually managed to implement the concepts these videos talked
about, like indirect rendering, many forms of culling, and even made my
own binary greedy mesher (the one you find online is completely
unreadable, so I made my own. I regret this, do not try it), which you
can find <a href="https://github.com/IVSOP/VoxelEngine">here</a>. Still,
I just felt like something was missing. It wasn’t interesting enough,
just shaping up to be another minecraft clone.</p>
<p>Some time ago I had seen some videos on an algorithm(?) called
marching cubes. The name itself is interesting. Where are they going?
How does a cube march?</p>
<p>After some head scratching, watching some videos and borrowing some
code, I managed to get it to work, and I felt like I had the skills to
keep going and make a full game out of it. It’s still minecraft-like
voxels, but it no longer looks like a minecraft clone, and presents many
different challenges.</p>
