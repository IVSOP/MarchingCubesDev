<h2 id="what-tldr">What (TLDR)</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm making a game with my own custom engine, and documenting the most
interesting/useful things I‚Äôve learned</p>
<p>I‚Äôm also going into it blind, never having used a game engine
before</p>
<p>I will also share my opinions on the things I use</p>
<h2 id="why">Why</h2>
<!-- I've always had an interest in videogames. I witnessed their evolution, and remember being blown away by minecraft, -->
<!-- as I could not comprehend that a computer could handle an infinite world where you could build and destroy anything. -->
<!-- Even a lever opening a door raised so many questions. How did the game know that this lever should open the door? -->
<!-- Why does it open instantly and not smoothly? How does anything about a game work? How do you make one? -->
<!-- I though someday I will be able to understand all of this and make my own game, with my own smooth doors. -->
<p>I‚Äôve always been interested in how games are made and how the engines
work under the hood.</p>
<p>Recently I‚Äôve done some small projects that enabled me to learn some
of the required skills. I started by experimenting with C++ and OpenGL,
learning completely on my own which brought me a lot of pain an
suffering. I will never forget my first textured quad. Taking
inspiration from <a href="https://youtu.be/lS_qeBy3aQI">this video</a>,
I made a <a href="https://github.com/IVSOP/Particles">particle
simulator</a>, which allowed me to learn some rendering concepts (like
batching and instancing) and also get comfortable with some optimization
techniques, like SIMD and spatial partitioning.</p>
<p>I then made an extremely naive implementation of a minecraft-like
game, teaching me some 3D skills. It also made me realize how much goes
into a 3D engine, and how performance intensive 3D graphics are when not
optimized properly.</p>
<p>At university, I got to do a very simple 3D graphics engine, which
pushed me to learn many more advanced concepts, like bloom, HDR and
color correction, rendering models and bezier surfaces, texture buffers,
framebuffers, blinn-phong lighting, and also learning the actual math
behind all of these. I just used the üêê <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">learnopengl</a> for this.</p>
<p>Eventually I came accross videos on voxel engines like <a href="https://youtu.be/40JzyaOYJeY">this</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/qnGoGq7DWMc?">this</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/NwP2VVnRt3Q">this</a>, which were so impressive
they re-sparked my interest for minecraft, and how I could make a better
version of it.</p>
<p>Recently I‚Äôve graduated in Software Engineering, and felt like I
finally had the skills to (begin to) tackle this.</p>
<p>I actually managed to implement the concepts these videos talked
about, like indirect rendering, many forms of culling, and even made my
own binary greedy mesher (the one you find online is completely
unreadable, so I made my own. I regret this, do not try it), which you
can find <a href="https://github.com/IVSOP/VoxelEngine">here</a>. Still,
I just felt like something was missing. It wasn‚Äôt interesting enough,
just shaping up to be another minecraft clone.</p>
<p>Some time ago I had seen some videos on an algorithm(?) called
marching cubes. The name itself is interesting. How does a cube
march?</p>
<p>After some head scratching, watching some videos and borrowing some
code, I managed to get it to work, and I felt like I had the skills to
keep going and make a full game out of it. It‚Äôs still minecraft-like
voxels, but it no longer looks like a minecraft clone, and presents many
different challenges.</p>
